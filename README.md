The main materials are divided into two folders, `cross-scale` and `within-scale`, corresponding to the cross- and within-scale
analyses, respectively. Each folder has self-contained instructions and data to reproduce the analyses in our paper.

The folder `figure1` contains a Jupyter notebook for generating the subplots of Figure 1 in the paper.
