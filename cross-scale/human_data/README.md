More details on the data are found below. For questions about any of the datasets, please refer to the original paper in which it was published, or contact the original authors.

## Ronai & Xiang (2022)

The key data and sentences were provided through personal correspondence with Eszter Ronai (2022-04-14) based on Ronai & Xiang (2022). Note that trial-level data (which contains the sentences) can be found at `rx22_processed_exp1.csv`. This file is used to generate test suites, but not in the final analysis.

## Pankratz & van Tiel (2021)

The data and sentences were downloaded on February 4, 2022 from the [OSF repository](https://osf.io/t3b4u/) for Pankratz & van Tiel (2021).

## Gotzner et al. (2018)

The key data were taken from Tables A1 and A2 in the appendix of Gotzner et al. (2018). 
The sentences were extracted based on a file sent through personal correspondence with Nicole Gotzner (2022-09-17).

## van Tiel et al. (2016)

The key data were taken from Table 3 of van Tiel et al. (2016), Experiment 2 ("-N" in the original table). The sentences for the neutral and nonneutral templates were taken from Appendix A
of the paper. The part of speech for each scale was manually annotated.
