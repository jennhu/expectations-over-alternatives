150826:22,but i wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well.
108790:55,"and then some of it is, some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in our, in urban society."

168216:15,"but they get into some really good conversations sometimes, you know."
26819:29,"and, i think, that they could get some results from that, because there are a lot of people who  are volunteer and community minded,"
148355:8,"even some of that i like  okay but not, mostly, as a general rule,"

169028:53,"uh, that 's kind of gone up in scale and, and some other things."
175702:23,"and i got a feeling that some of that was involved in the, uh, early decisions of the vietnam war. that the, uh, people saw the cold war as, uh, you had  to draw a line and, and defend it."

31180:58,"and, uh, you know, i, i've, in hindsight, seen some things that i wished that, you know, i had done something about  that  was, you know, within my power or, uh, you know, wish that in some ways we, as parents, had more control over what 's happening up there, you know, type thing."
171692:24,"and, uh, they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth."

128104:24,"i mean, they'll have some things  in there that  almost, almost, you know, like supernatural, or something, you know,"
103911:47,"and, and, it really isn't, for some people tha-, who  have been there for over, and over, and over, it really isn't, uh, as bad."

131722:36,"i probably need  to take some, some more lessons, uh, more current and, uh, and practice more often."
164259:34,"but, i think you have  to accept some of the errors."
74649:24,"you know, if there's some gauge that they could make ."
132933:5,some of the cars that i got  were like the toyota camry and the nissan maxima and some of the competitors
120456:22,and i just started  ordering some parts
170188:13,we actually do some work with some people down at georgia tech.
12194:43,"well you might, uh, generate some yeah, you might generate some interest in it."
113793:23,"and, uh, seems like some rather large chunks of money could come from, from that direction."
134479:41,"i, i, i worked on some of it at t i once upon a time."
161487:13,so you got some lakes around you can do that on .
80499:4,some people are a little bit fanatical about it.
158511:44,"i think, i think there's definitely been some changes, um,"
15870:42,and then i also had a friend who  was just around some people that  were smoking cocaine.
120455:20,"and they had, uh, some names, some companies that  sold mustang parts,"
56417:25,oh. you ought  to try some crawfish.
55920:12,and we got some great public works out of it.
145722:97,"i didn't, you know, i, i didn't even know their names, some of the two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles"
115916:39,"but, uh, there's, uh, some, some stuff that i want  to do  with like sierra club and go down to grand canyon or something like that."
27507:15,"and then they wanted some gray to do the,  to do the trim."
171283:28,"some, some cases in some jurisdictions, they can do that."
155408:25,so so there is some good to it.
147340:7,"and some of them are limited care  too where people can do, uh,"
116940:96,"well, maybe this thing with, with the child at school, maybe that will make people think a bit more and, you know, take some steps  to, to correct it."
159146:13,"you know some of the health insurance is written  that way. you know, that, uh, if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy, you know, it s-, pre specified in the policy so much"
171283:17,"some, some cases in some jurisdictions, they can do that."
2454:46,"and where we are  now, what we're doing  is some very big lawsuits that  happen  to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents."
22799:53,"but, um, we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted  to give him some medication to sort of, you know keep him real out of it all the time"
166169:26,"i do know for a fact that some of the teachers that i know  personally get paid  an awful lot more than,"
146091:18,"um, i've done some cross stitching."
161668:20,"you actually, some catamarans you can actually pull people  behind , the skiers,"
74580:17,"that's, uh, some pretty good ideas."
30391:26,"we have, you know, used some of it for some personal things."
30872:58,"it was really, i mean the hollywood really must think there's some real dummies out there or something."
168576:39,"and, uh i can imagine that, uh, uh, for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case."
104255:44,"does it, does it offer, like band, or some of the instruments."
30987:12,but they changed some things in the movie.
141909:6,"or some things are, um, you know,"
9455:69,"well, i mean, i, i, i guess i've been in some places, you know, where the weather was just so mild , you know, places like monterey, california or, you know,"
140415:37,"um, well before we built our home we were managing some apartments that we were living in ,"
86455:28,"and you, there were some places, where people, defini-,"
112637:73,"i would like  to do that  as a, as a family and, and some t v watching."
1214:19,"i put a stop to some of them as far as the door to door, either religious groups, or people peddling products."
21123:14,"i think some of the tones of the, the daily prime time is questionable,"
22656:29,"so, we thought well, maybe there are some crab in here,"
130807:72,"and one way that we do it sort of in, in iowa  is that we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops."
157516:9,"and in some cases if it's a long trial, the desire  of people  to get out of there and not be stuck  in there for a very long time, that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons."
97584:19,well hopefully i can do some consulting work at home.
29227:52,"i, uh, i think we both agree there's some problems there"
95651:89,"so, i, i, uh, i, i, i feel like it should be mandatory in some professions,"
126348:16,"i guess in some cases they just consider  pickup your, your phone and, and, and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not."
110384:95,"but i've really noticed that there are a lot of, uh, a lot more people that  are more comfortable, at least, with some women being home and, at least in the circles i've travelled  and in the church that i go to , you know,"
164345:22,"well, i think that in some cases, it is warranted."
19474:11,they had some real fancy names for them.
31480:39,"but i would think that, um, that some guidelines could be set  up to avoid that."
78294:14,"they've had some terrible problems with hispanics,"
57998:87,"i-, if they could just cut out all the fat and, and get it lean, and start  addressing some of the other issues, i think  we could take care of everything. and quit  taking care of all these other countries all across the world, you know, who  just end up  using things against us later on anyway."
44952:36,"i mean, i'm sure you heard about some of ours."
92394:53,"i mean, there there's a little bit, because there's some of those english words that you just don't exactly know what they mean  ,"
79761:35,"and he said, um, let's give her some race horse shots."
112058:22,"i sometimes have a problem with some of the, especially more famous people who  all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork  to say that whatever problems they have , you know, was, was because they were abused a-, abused  as children."
155521:29,and i i've seen some of them like that too
87654:14,"i guess some of the best things i've ever had , um, i, some of them were just hors d'oeuvres, you know."
41388:61,"i think there was four or five different people, that  would call, you know, some of them, if they didn't have their addresses and all on them,"
32577:19,"next year i was planting some broccoli and, and some of those, they're called  cabbage,  cabbage loppers, or whatever."
29678:24,people say let me see some of your work.
85881:104,"i guess we're going  to have a lot of parades  this weekend in honor of these guys that  are, that  did some stuff over in the gulf."
109712:50,"but the trucks that  were supposed to do it, there's been some problems with  from what i've read  in, you know, the mail that we get"
139879:19,"well, you've got some experience behind you in the work force."
97813:26,"and, you know, maybe do some free lance type work at home."
156465:52,"i mean, it  seems absurd that people will pay, you know, some bucks just  to get someone to,"
170859:54,"uh, i've had, uh, three boys  through, i guess, uh, some child care, each one of them"
31279:10,do some things that  are totally different and unheard of.
121757:115,"if i was having a dinner party i would probably, um, have some, um, some, uh, um, some fruit to start with  with some apples sliced up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and, um, probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some, uh, uh, salsa and chips  around and peanuts."
39653:15,and you can put some cucumber slices on too.
6581:42,"but i guess, they, you could put some money  aside while you were there, your expenses and,"
156671:38,"but if you could find a way to prevent some of it , and i'm not sure what it would be . it would be money better  spent than,"
63704:23,"now, okay, we run into some problems once,"
146662:13,and there are some fire stations i can take newspapers to
20307:42,i thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there.
81221:70,"i think you have to let, yo-, you got  to segregate some of it."
95645:41,"well, i, i feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that  have happened lately, that i think there are some occupations that they should, such as the health field, the transportation field, uh,"
146544:24,"i do think that there are some significant kinds of things to to look for  , you know, if you are faced  with placing someone. in a place like that, uh, you know, aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that  is offered  and such"
136383:15,or you been doing some remodeling work on it.
81838:54,"so it 's kind of hard at that point to, you know, classify some of the builders."
160994:25,"but there's some also some, uh, not so smart ones."
83056:37,"uh, we're probably making a comparison against, uh, some european and, uh, and, uh, uh, s-s-say, newer republics that, uh, that  have very high percentages."
97004:103,"because, uh, i, i guess i placed all but one or two of my calls. and, uh, only because i going  to make some money,"
15155:80,"i mean, and it 's nice to, to try  to teach young people some, some, uh, uh, civil, uh, consciousness,"
30504:13,and we have some education programs that he likes .
39049:23,"in the winter time i usually plant some pansies in there,"
84185:16,now i have got some daffodils.
24056:22,but i know there are some fields where it's really not necessary .
135381:35,"to me, half the time it's more fascinating than some of these made up stories."
155741:63,"i think by  putting term limitations on you could, you could slow down some of the problems."
67111:87,"and some, some of the people, uh, some of the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too, are picking up some of those great big houses,"
20734:79,"they'll help you, recycle, because we, there is some bins, like behind wal-mart, that  take some things."
149904:6,"and some superficial type damage,"
118753:13,i think in some ways that  they need  to be more careful of the teachers that they hire .
117354:63,"i just still have need for the four bedrooms  just having company from time to time. and some of them coming back home and things, you know."
72832:14,there may be some schools you could read about  and learn.
129171:26,what do you feel  are some of the main problems.
56317:78,"and while that's cooking, i take mayonnaise, about a cup of mayonnaise, and a teaspoon of mustard, and some garlic powder,"
91286:72,"yet, like, say, you know, the university of small town in arkansas or something, might have some top specialists in my area."
146901:36,"because i had some appointments at the office  today, some interviews"
129083:10,they have some good management principals in this new generation.
80278:17,it's just some of those women that  come up there  looking like arnold schwarzenegger's sister just doesn't get it.
130276:4,"some people,"
15749:21,"well, now, we had some friends that  went  to see it"
63108:7,"and some of them require me to go out of town,"
95586:13,it's got some pretty strong competitors.
36621:7,but some of them are really nice
107709:28,and i think we'll probably experience some of your weather although i think they have more humidity.
138943:28,"you may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like we've been getting  in december,"
112498:14,and save you some money too.
36613:5,some of them are pretty rough.
11767:21,"and i hope you enjoy some more good movies late-,"
38898:13,and i did some of that.
35576:25,"and i was picking up, uh, some background noise,"
114610:10,we get some killer winters up here in the mountains.
121757:169,"if i was having a dinner party i would probably, um, have some, um, some, uh, um, some fruit to start with  with some apples sliced up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and, um, probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some, uh, uh, salsa and chips  around and peanuts."
1843:22,"i mean i've heard some songs that, that i just thought  were horrendous cover versions of,"
56109:69,"it 's just probably a good thing that the oil's burning and may, may, make some people realize that hey, you know, this stuff runs out."
155092:75,"well our situation is just a little bit, kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently, uh, took on a full time job,"
126761:25,"e-, even in some families some people talk a little bit different."
177328:13,"i've done some other things too. uh, you know."
13977:49,"i think they should either do that, or, or afford some time to the military, or, or  helping elderly people."
176960:92,"at the bottom end, they, uh, are always willing  to, uh, let in cheap labor if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the, powerful people in that area."
55386:25,and he's had his problems with some of the old guard himself.
170740:34,because i know my grandparents wanted  to have some independence still.
38927:18,but i have recently done some cross stitch.
169939:81,"and it didn't look like, uh, you know, how, yo-, you, you walk into some rooms  and there's, it's completely generic."
126761:30,"e-, even in some families some people talk a little bit different."
156938:9,"but in some cases, yes."
31278:24,maybe there need  to be some radical changes made.
10841:72,"but, uh, uh, it, it did show some, some, uh, some interesting things about the f b i"
16319:19,go  buy me some strawberries.
75552:115,"it's kind of scary when i think of what  will happen in twenty years, you know, when i have kids and they're grown  and, uh, just kind of some of the changes that  will happen even more"
56842:9,"uh, some countries voting is obligatory."
53389:28,"i, sometimes i hear some things on, on the radio."
130958:7,but some of those are pretty big.
108790:33,"and then some of it is, some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in our, in urban society."
166774:13,but there's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able  to deal with  physically anymore.
30001:7,"but some things, especially letters, if they suggest certain colors for letters, i just go with whatever i want  to ."
163414:55,"i guess i k-, i think it's got some relevance,"
94780:11,"and, uh some people do"
8866:65,"and that, oh, i guess, ranges anywhere from, uh, carpentry work to, um, um, some types of furniture and, um, oh, i don't know what you would call them , knickknacks, i guess, stuff you hang  on the wall  to put a mirror on"
122706:39,where they may have just had a teaching major and then had some social studies courses
111758:13,"and i had some time off in the afternoon,"
90051:29,"so, i told them he strangled on some chicken"
35130:35,"i sit, i sit and watch some shows,"
2199:135,"and they did an analysis  for us based on what we were putting  in and the time frame that we wanted  to look at , and then gave us a good idea back, you know, some good information  back on whether or not we were going  to achieve those goals, and, or not, and what we needed  to do  so that we could achieve them and the money we could put  in at what time."
72090:7,and some of them are real short
134176:70,"and we'll let them try  to drink out of some of the lakes and try  to fish in some of the lakes that  have been suffering from, uh, the, uh, acid rain"
109394:16,"but i guess some of the other smaller colleges might, might be a lot different."
47430:120,"speaking of bush, we're going  to get a little off topic but speaking of bush, they that had a story where he went  to visit some little, uh, elementary school students, and stuff ."
34149:38,"you can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have, uh, competition."
132454:18,it beats memberships at some of these clubs.
107258:36,and i think though that we need  to have some liquid  around that you don't have  to go through the company  to get .
102016:6,and some hard-boiled eggs.
99170:29,"i, i think some of the dress codes are different at different schools."
158120:17,"like say some young kids or something like that that  might be inclined more towards a life of crime, had  to sit and watch and, and see a guy burn or, or, you know, something or shot  by a firing squad or something like that."
89068:107,"but, uh, so when you are first going to school  that, you kind of have the luxury of  being able  to have some latitude in choosing the place to go ."
131517:11,"especially in some of these schools around here, i think they have about twenty percent older students."
96870:36,"they were. i was listening to some of the comments on ra-, television  the other day, uh, about it,"
94784:6,and some people don't.
51562:11,they had some other expenses that  came up
13347:26,"well, it seems that there's some things like the, uh, the programs at least just go around and, and, and clean up streets and, and, and pick up trash and even aluminum cans and some of these kinds of things."
24192:41,"and, um, i also have a good languages background, linguistics. and some psychology."
58962:27,"ye-, you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else"
147337:25,i am sure you have got some really good nursing homes around dallas.
50706:31,it  would be great to have some of those organizations like you mentioned  that  were during the depression or coming out of the depression available for kids.
135016:25,"um, i try  to do some painting, although i'm not very good at it."
38792:27,it's a lot about spiritual warfare and some things like that.
149736:22,"and, uh, they've had some impact, but not a tremendous amount,"
13059:11,"i sold some of them,"
95345:10,"i do some p c stand alone work on it,"
97320:78,"i was rea-, i was really looking forward to summer, thinking oh, we are going  to have some time off."
42183:38,"uh, i can't remember what the town was , some little area."
45067:40,"and, okay, this, this candidate tells you some things that  are going  to happen"
7361:10,they have some nice stuff down there.
59953:42,"i wonder if a judge didn't have control of that if some of that would change, you know."
152359:98,"although he, you know, the more complex your structure  the, uh, less difficult it  is  to kind of carry some things through"
161018:14,"i mean, some people seem fairly well suited for for, uh, miniature poodles and such."
129179:18,"uh, in dallas, some of the major problems, uh,"
39025:60,"and whenever i go  visit my parents , they're always saying, well, bring some of your tapes."
66763:14,"but, um, some of these people are just out and out brutal."
127011:17,i can associate with some of the people in that movie because of the young students i see  over at the medical school.
101025:37,"but from talking to people in other districts there are some major problems, uh, with dropouts."
131523:14,i've seen some people that  are really quite up there you know
13424:16,"and in fact, some of these things i get , some of these questionnaires,"
151338:21,"uh, like i said, some industries, though, i think it'd be very necessary,"
122792:22,"well, if you play with some consistency though, you can get it right back down."
39625:37,"sliced tomatoes and then green pepper strips, just over it, and some red onion slices, and just a little bit of, um, basil, and then a little italian dressing over it."
43046:79,"it would be an interesting, it  would be even more interesting you, you to be some of these people who  are at the other end of the spectrum."
164185:22,"i, in some ways, it's almost worse than murder."
70851:34,"and, uh, so, we had  to make some adjustments"
91333:59,"um, you know, when i first was applying for graduate schools , i applied to some big programs , you know, in this area, like stevens institute of technology, which  is recognized  in the northeast as, as, you know, one step below m i t in a sense, you know,"
159281:32,"and, uh, then i had  to do some volunteer work here in tyler, texas"
4008:21,"he did, well, in some of the later movies"
4457:24,"so, there must be something to some of them."
167015:43,"and there r-, there are s-, some substantial, nasty penalties, um, if you, if businesses try  to avoid that."
67607:18,"i mean there are some people,"
55892:50,"uh, and i find ways  to, to turn some of that back to, to others ."
87190:11,"that's some of the things i think  about it,"
142780:82,"as far as the rangers are concerned , i think, i think they need some, definitely need some pitching."
2006:5,"some of it,"
163703:15,"i think some of them, the artists are even, uh, hitting the pop charts."
7282:17,"kind of gives you some space for yourself,"
157519:107,"i'd read one book, i think it was calls  trial by jury of all things, that, uh  went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases, and in many cases  looking at what  had, at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right, went back to the jurors, uh, based on the deliberations."
127350:66,"i've, i've heard they're, i hear you have some problems."
106267:29,i'd have  to go back through some expense reports.
143543:20,"and there are, uh, some fairly sophisticated approaches that  are used  in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people, uh, gain a competence with respect to the material."
75025:28,"i mean we need  to redo some, rewiring ourselves"
169902:90,"i, i think sometimes, you know, i've noticed, uh, people asking for, uh, some of the patients asking for things , uh, just repetitively and, but things that  are not reasonable,"
69673:14,"they've mumblex some companies that  are doing, uh, hair tests."
42623:15,"i mean, some of these saturday night specials that these companies put  out, that  are, pie-, i mean, they're are"
169857:78,"i think i'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention  and, uh, where they did some things  to try  to keep them, um, mentally alive . and where there was, uh, caring and compassionate, where there were caring and compassionate people, uh, operating it ."
84633:31,"i mean, they are eighteen to twenty-four, some of the young men and women."
123034:17,"i know maybe some of the big things that, uh, uh,"
32942:10,they have some little buds on them
39035:20,"and they said, bring some tapes with you."
20045:19,even better than jaws and some of that.
66700:13,"you know some people on the case were, were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges"
108757:10,"um, some of it, um,"
91185:45,"but some of the, uh, the small, some of the larger small schools, you know, i guess around three or four thousand students have a, can offer a broader range of curriculums and things,"
149748:21,"you know, particularly in some of the housing projects, uh, you know, that's, that tends  to be where a lot of that crime is focused"
93765:12,"so they took some time off that, uh, they could show us around."
38055:13,"and i process some ratings and put, do graphics for their television stations, mumblex their clients,"
87128:10,"there's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in washington. regardless of the racial makeup,"
62717:78,"but that's one thing  to be said  for credit. it, how, it gets you some muscle where you need it  ."
44903:37,"and ma-, maybe let them have some mock, i mean uh, you know elections and stuff and vote for different people in their classes and start  really young."
22696:54,"i guess the weirdest thing i've ever caught  is, uh, in some of the inlets and the rivers around mumblex delaware."
61208:34,"and the, the ground will filter some of it but not all of it."
66700:68,"you know some people on the case were, were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges"
115343:46,"i read, uh, a lot of steven king, dean r koontz, uh some danielle steel."
102998:7,"but some of the different things we're doing , uh there's just not a time, enough time to do it all"
7758:15,"but, there are some others out there that i don't believe  deserve the money they're getting ."
133518:49,"well, it went pretty well, uh, other than the fact that we encountered some, uh, problems that you run across  in older homes with plumbing, which one thing led to another ,"
142083:50,"some, uh, you know, i have some good shots and some bad shots."
45097:7,"now some people object during primaries,  having  to declare a party, whether republican or democrat"
128696:11,they have some of those in ohio.
146829:11,you see some of the stuff
121775:13,"um, maybe some rolls and, um, i guess  some, uh, some rice or something like that."
50456:132,"you know, we, we've got folks running around here who  get, who  get degrees in basket weaving and you know, underwater psychology, or some, some ridiculous stuff like that."
104342:23,"and i couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was, was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were ."
128305:9,"occasionally, some ice skating will come on, on a sunday or during the olympics"
70357:25,"and, they have, of course, some pretty severe storms, winter storms, snow and that type of thing."
144063:31,"well, th-, there were some people that, uh, that  had a problem with that. because they found out later on that, jeez, you know, a guy will lie rather than get killed ."
108856:73,"you can't understand what they're saying  on some of those songs which  probably is just as well on some of them, too."
141004:32,and then they'll get  to pick out some of those favorite snacks that they get  to pick  out
2345:21,"i, uh, have attended some seminars that  had some tapes that  went with them, but, uh, i guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things,"
19745:104,"if you ever get a chance to go over to vicksburg, the battleground at vicksburg, uh, there's an area there where there was, uh, some texas, uh, groups"
133013:23,"um, and it really saved us some big money once."
11082:15,but they're predicting some more snow for our direction.
134301:16,"or, just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty."
125857:6,"and some days he doesn't,"
122421:31,"uh, what, what are some of the shows that you have been able  to rent   though."
54373:11,there are some kurds living in iran.
26057:49,"well, having, having been out of the credit game for some years now, i've gotten used to  either paying in cash or not getting it."
18479:6,"and some places, they, they, they really nail them for tax."
99651:29,"well, it sounds like he's got some really, you know, good strong ideas of what he wants  to do ."
71201:52,"uh, i kn-, i'm familiar with some, some upbeat school areas,"
20722:22,i know they're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there.
42470:35,"but somewhere we've got  to come up with some money to build,  to build more, you know, and keep these people in them, you know."
105485:20,"but, uh, we did some water skiing , of course, and, and, uh, driving around the lake in the boat"
168607:32,"and i thin-, there's also some, uh, i think, uh, poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time."
52983:20,"i know there are some good places to go  camping  along the, uh, the lakes."
51876:10,you get some kids in there
158476:38,"but they also did, they also did some of the teaching things"
99247:72,"i think the elementary school teachers, or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than, than some of the high school teachers, i think."
6396:60,"and then i think there's, i mean i think there's some negatives,"
17721:21,"i've, uh, had some health problems that  have led me to, uh,"
65910:42,i would like  to be a little more into investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems. and to come up with something a little better than what we've got .
77759:32,but i think it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few more hours.
66134:57,"i, uh, i'm trying my best right now  to pay off some of mine."
16212:24,"i was going  to make some, uh, like fish chunks and dip it in the fondue."
70974:78,"so. but, um, that's the hardest part for us is that it's really, um, you know, budgeting and some extra things, you know, for-, that  are more, you know, nonessential items."
125802:14,"you know, some places just specialize in just real little ones"
17546:43,"and, after i, i graduated, i read some of the old classics that i just bluffed my way through  and have found that i enjoy them quite a bit, too, uh,"
13296:18,"there are, uh, some groups that  have their children, you know, go away for a year."
167359:42,"and, uh they have put plastic, plexiglas kind of stuff in some of the windows."
14833:77,"we're going  to solve, try  to solve the aids problem while, while, you know, some people are getting killed  here and there"
121783:13,that would take some planning
148130:31,"uh, i suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth, because i do get things from ski associations and things, uh, at, during the year."
155085:10,"find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able  to, uh, do it ."
168991:40,"so. but, uh, you know, for some people that's good."
162314:57,"i, i guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that"
157961:33,"and it has, um, helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldn't otherwise  that i think  are wonderful particularly at this age,"
135453:35,"i know, uh, the bri-, some of the british people laugh at us because we're so enthralled with their royalty."
76160:21,"and so, i think some of the things that i did  paid off."
64969:22,and i hope you get some more calls and make some more calls.
79557:42,"i, i'm glad,  to see some of these things, i think ."
81720:33,"and he's trying  to save the land from some, ooze."
45790:32,"now, they've been able  to get some good players and come around"
1206:10,and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that i don't even understand .
72488:43,"but we may have  to give up on some, some things."
117330:23,it ended up i got some furniture  back that one of them had moved  out or something.
27773:13,i listen to some country and western
141908:36,"well, it seems like, i don't know, some things are sensationalized"
64299:18,"the other day we had some hail, the biggest hail i've ever seen  in texas."
9524:43,"well i mean i've had some pretty bad, i guess some pretty controversial topics"
2582:17,well i've seen some people try  to just come in like over the weekend because they want  to use the texteller machine.
3372:16,they came up with some pretty weird stuff after that.
164949:21,"ended up  getting some scholarships to go to college  and which  has been, you know, which  is really nice,"
66483:25,what 's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years.
59544:10,"and then some of the bigger companies,"
33291:14,make hot dogs or some potato chips
172002:14,there would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed  a jury trial .
38641:36,"i've always wanted  to go back and read some of my literature texts from college um, because i enjoyed some of those stories so much,"
63398:14,they even have some late night ones for people that  work second shift and things like that.
172589:128,"when you have the, when you have the, uh, the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has  , and you can, uh, offer some incentive"
136292:43,"we've been getting quite a bit, maybe not quite as bad as some of the folks down around san antonio,"
153785:23,"you know, i have done some bow hunting"
86100:26,you have  to have some compassion some humanness.
138350:6,and some ways i didn't.
103644:40,"i, i think, with solving some of the energy, future energy problems, we'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well."
70123:18,at least y'all are getting some rain up in dallas.
16456:40,"you put, um, really good vanilla favoring  in it and some butter"
31195:47,"but, uh, still i, i questioned the ability of some of the teachers to, uh, really do a bang-up job,"
166876:51,i think that should be left  up to people who  have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have.
28597:28,"and we, uh, got a quote on some laser printers  the other day at six hundred dollars."
23951:137,"and if you take, uh, little pieces of pork  and you fry them, like little cubes of pork. and you fry them with garlic and a little bit of, couple dashes of hot pepper and then mix some hoi sin sauce with sherry, just a little sherry  to thin it, and stir that in."
162249:54,"but, uh, there's a four o one k plan uh, for, uh, sheltering some taxable income."
154986:45,"and then i, and then they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that  do the canning of the pop and the beer as as well."
362:44,"that's just a matter of defining priorities, i guess or some priorities anyway."
31533:12,and it takes some drastic steps at this point.
136205:15,so there has been some flooding
159592:14,"but, uh, some of these groups now like slaughter."
100603:25,"usually there has  to be some wealth involved, which  is great, if, if you're financially, if, if you don't make the decisions so late that you're worried about money"
97106:13,"it's, some good, some bad, uh,"
20176:47,"so i think in, in some as-, some ways we are, uh, becoming a little too egalitarian in that, in that sense,"
43559:43,you wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things .
82687:34,"but, you know, i know there are some days when she wi-, she wishes she was back at work ."
16608:27,i was trying  to think about some of my favorite people that i liked  in music
160988:9,"but also some poodles, uh"
12998:28,"and he, he likes some of the new groups like shenandoah,"
63963:80,"i, i wonder about some of the prod-, products that they don't take , like some of the plastics and things that they don't take . uh, why, why they couldn't do more recycling with those ."
72420:95,"there are a lot of jobs that  are coming about, like in computers at home, and those types of things, that  would at least in some ways, um, bridge the gap."
177493:13,i've cut some one by eight oak before.
84120:11,there was some plants that  are just spring bloomers
77843:15,every weekend there was some visiting somewhere.
123916:50,i don't know who  played when and who  does what like some guys are.
99608:4,"some schools i know  give, uh, oh,"
28274:4,some kids are really having it.
38651:29,"um, i trying  to think of some of my other favorite books,"
4489:44,"and, uh, so it's had that orientation for quite some time."
148463:10,"um, some of it sounds more like pop music."
71322:37,"in germany or in, in england in some cases people in my income level, at least, allege that they pay up to six-, fifty-five percent of their gross income in taxes."
152284:11,like in some of the large oil companies. there has been massive lay offs.
97229:18,or we really do develop some health problems.
143752:15,it seems that some of them have gotten higher
50719:6,and some people would get military service
168823:14,"but there were some things  that people brought  up like well what  happens if they, they get a false positive, you know, what recourse do you have ."
168236:157,"uh, and really, i-, i-, we were really forced  into  keeping a budget because i'm, i'm paid once a month which  sort of, sort of forces some, uh, uh, restrictions"
33143:60,"but there's, uh, they're a pain to peel  for some people."
20838:36,"and so, you know, when i found out some places to take it"
151303:29,"well, you know, you can take some of that, that testing a little bit too far."
60960:37,"on channel thirteen, uh, they had some, some programs the day before,"
75571:7,and some of the other ones weren't born.
43815:11,there's some nice stuff  over there to see .
26291:55,"and, and, it's, it's limited application in some respects."
55120:15,"boy, they'd some big changes, speaking of them."
7100:11,"well, and some people use one credit card  to pay for another credit card they own ,"
71321:4,"some states they pay, uh,"
138141:9,put some shelves in
77852:30,"we, although we have some relatives in the area that we, we see , we,"
89259:13,i think some parents go a little bit overboard.
98986:4,"some people just sit on them once in their lifetime, you know, if they're that lucky sometimes. or, you know, what, whatever the case may be . and, and may not have any idea of what, what the standard punishment  would be  for it."
32953:16,"and i've got some broccoli, uh, onions some, some radishes and, uh, uh, beets."
166806:63,"i think that a majority of the places in the u s, uh, you know, there is some government aid available,"
111407:85,"i was just in the shower after  finishing mowing the lawn and, you know,  mowing the lawn and removing some old petunias out of the garden,"
160087:28,"uh, you know, as sort of some development and some training, uh,"
176211:25,i'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere.
140818:41,"well, we've heard bad, we've heard some bad things about some of those, you know,"
80438:40,"but when you get into some of these, some of health clubs where you just stand around and wait  ."
124760:28,"that might help a little bit, especially in some places."
61917:28,and also i'm interested in writing some programs that  will kind of like remind me of things like remind me that wednesdays is trash day and the like.
33466:11,i got some interesting information about crawfish
139729:13,we've got some children
38592:10,"right now some of the things i'm working with  are kids that  are dealing with sexual abuse,"
72079:13,"or sand even some of them,"
127456:31,"oh, i, i know some of the people."
88001:23,"that would provide, uh, possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things, see."
61752:73,"so, uh, we got, we, we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it, you know, so that he couldn't get out."
87240:87,"and i, i, i, i have  to think that, that it has some influence on it."
140196:19,"uh, and then what some people would consider  a little more difficult, i, i'll change spark plugs"
128489:17,"but if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning, just like brushing your teeth you're going  to spend fifteen minutes or a half hour."
3878:16,well i've gotten some good ideas from you.
156086:35,"well, not, not as hard as some places out west because you don't get the, uh, major pollution sources as you do out in denver  with the inversion and los angeles and a-, rest of california which  is just terrible it sounds."
174581:22,"and, of course, you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money  keeping people in jail or not."
161281:21,"i'm into, uh, some industrial music that 's, a, a bit even harder than that."
76223:21,"anyway, it ended up after some pretty, uh, heavy bidding, that i got all those bricks for forty dollars."
118955:17,"these, some of these young kids you read about ,  just doesn't bother them to kill someone at all"
136135:14,"he does have some real bizarre things, i think ."
95853:38,"and, and i'm not sure but what some of the insurance claims aren't due to, uh, illnesses brought on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse."
138703:48,"same sort of problem that  happens sometimes is these, some of these, uh, like aids tests and such."
71046:43,"well, uh, but i do realize that, that is realistic for some people,"
151138:37,"but, uh, they, they have done some testing around our office, mostly after lunch,  looking for people drinking, uh, drinking beer and stuff at lunch time,"
53598:10,"we got some awful rain, uh, the other morning."
21020:14,"but, uh, some of the crap that 's on t v nowadays, it's about."
83988:6,"and some people will still buy them, you know,"
138154:56,"uh, a few years ago, uh, we needed, uh, they needed some book shelves"
84117:33,and i just went out this weekend and bought me some plants and stuff.
36312:38,"i think youngsters ought  to go out and do some public service,"
161373:22,"but i also dislike, uh, some classical music,"
168977:55,"and they have, uh, you know, in, in some cases they have a greater self-esteem because they can say, they can see that, you know, if i do something or sub-, submit my own will to the will of the sargent or whatever, at least for a short period of time, i can accomplish a lot"
24443:14,"there are just some people that i, you know,"
71540:47,"in fact, i was going  to go out today  to buy some plants so i could put them in,"
62690:49,"and they say they can, you know, do something different and change some connectors"
159588:39,"i, i even like guns and roses, some of their stuff."
125651:10,"um, some of the qualifications that i look for  was that, uh, you know, the cost, and, um, exactly what they did , if it was structured or nonstructured, if they had a little academic, um, uh, in there, and, um, you know, um, you know, what the qualifications of the teachers' were , and if the place was clean and um, the hours"
9507:75,"well i guess this, the weather isn't as lively a topic as, uh, as some of the others we might have gotten ."
169366:50,"and i can, i can, you know, accept that some people think it's not and can find better ways to use it ."
96866:33,and so. but i know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of  doing the job.
103574:12,my line gets some static.
107802:43,"i, it, i have worked in some campaigns"
110628:20,"um, but she might have some contacts here,"
124787:54,"i really think, uh, you know, we're doing some, some important things."
80001:13,"i've got some applications,"
170022:25,a couple of times we've tried some things
74155:5,some of these are urban worries
47182:40,"so, i'd go up somewhere and camp overnight and then do some rafting."
71600:26,"and she cooks them for an hour with some fat backs,,"
138469:69,"then, then on the other hand i think it 's harder to stay home in some regards."
82296:18,"and they were just screening some candidates,"
116252:35,"i, i think there are some areas where we, where we, uh, pretty well, you know, get our money's worth ,"
27056:5,some of them were even better behaved.
97543:11,"i have some friends that  have children,"
135035:25,"i, i do some sewing, mostly out of necessity."
173724:18,"and by definition, for some of us, at least, the public good includes having an educated populace and then idea that, uh, you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes in the, at the local level or bigger votes at the national level."
12611:177,"and i think that's the problem the p l o has  is that when they, whenever one group of them decides that they're going  to negotiate, or they're going  to do something, they're going  to try  to make some peace , but, uh, the end result is that they, there so many factions of them and, uh, some more violent than others, some with a certain agenda different than the others, or they split,"
124385:34,"but now i, i do like some of these, uh, brighter, fluorescent colors."
104196:61,"not, not, you know, the bouncy, you know sing along kind but some of the old, older ones that"
29416:66,"um, it, it, it  was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind , you know,"
52283:13,i mean some of them are done  good
100889:88,"and maybe, uh, maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back . um, if we've lost some of that"
159124:81,who it really penalizes  is their insurance company which  then translates into higher rates for all of us. if they get some of those mega awards against them.
126604:16,"som-, some kids are so spoiled nowadays"
29177:21,"they need  to put some sternness back into the, into the teachers and let them be able  to, uh, get the old whip out and get some discipline."
153105:51,they're their cat was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens
47262:53,"the, uh, the movie, the doors, has so-, some nice desert scenes,"
130776:68,"and, uh, so, you know, if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings, anything that they can pass  on to the consumer, you know,"
139682:16,"we've got, some children who  would just really, uh, enjoy  having an animal, you know, a dog, i think"
25608:31,"and then, you know, we've got some guys here that  they are, you know, four and five handicappers"
143183:27,it sounds like we've been to some of the same places.
31271:110,"are the rest of us who  went for the big bucks, you know, staying out of, you know, where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated  to spend some time  teaching or something with these kids ."
53606:58,"apparently, i, i don't know if it was just the strong winds or some small tornadoes up this way too."
93264:4,"some people are compl-, now are complaining because the stuff isn't picked  up at the curbside, you know,"
42653:25,"and, and if some of them are doing something that they shouldn't be  and then they have one of those toy guns in their hands"
41573:26,"but then usually when you find out some information from like your parents , then you can find out from, you know, you can find somebody else that  can tell you something else about these,"
129990:36,"although just, just about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that, uh,  work in the library for me said they hadn't gotten theirs."
145369:58,"i h-, i have, we have some, some friends that  did the, exactly the same thing."
44119:16,"so we still have some of that trim work to do  because we put it off all this time,"
78762:25,"but, even, even some little ones do pretty good"
100584:49,"you know, go to the dining room and, and eat some good meals."
172656:9,at least some companies.
96656:11,"we have some engineers that  still,"
168218:13,and they have some good feedback and all that stuff
160087:35,"uh, you know, as sort of some development and some training, uh,"
96034:46,"well, as a matter of fact, uh, my mother was going through some things  not lon-, not long ago, i guess it has been a couple of years ago, in an old trunk that she had ."
4529:7,and some of them were disastrous
131278:6,"and some ways, it might be kind of scary."
149891:51,"i've actually, i've known, known some people that  have had their cars stolen ."
169856:19,"uh, but, uh, some friends of mine have, uh, gone through this."
54017:18,"just when i get some spare time here and there  i'll work on it,"
70703:18,"well, i've done some rewiring on it."
18660:24,"i used it on, uh, some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased  to leave it."
113457:49,"and when the cowboys won the superbowl here , of course, they put together some real cute songs,"
11233:53,"you know that was one thing we noticed  last week that we had some new people move into our building and, you know, the nice cardboard boxes that you move, packing boxes. and they were just used  one time and thrown  in the dumpster"
91388:33,"so you've really, uh, i guess sacrificed some social exposure to different groups and everything."
145009:13,"and you hear some people say, you know, well, he's a man,"
86451:40,"the only thing i didn't like  was in some of the more touristy areas uh, um, the, it would just be besieged  by people wanting to be your guide"
30493:38,"there are some definitely, some, some advantages to it."
9797:33,"i've, i've seen some of them on repeats."
19744:12,"they were some groups of it, the vicksburg,"
174864:19,"so, uh, there's some noise on this end."
108807:56,"um, i don't like  to listen to it all the time, but, um, some of the time, anyway."
107469:25,"and there are, you know, some places that  will set up you know for old newspapers and stuff."
47147:12,and there's some real nice ones in arkansas.
49875:48,"uh, they still have some, some, uh, some draft picks, uh, that they got ,"

38641:72,"i've always wanted  to go back and read some of my literature texts from college um, because i enjoyed some of those stories so much,"
138298:34,it's an opportunity to get out and relieve some of the pressure that you feel  day to day
162002:32,"and, uh, we're looking at, uh, some just four door, five passenger sedans as well."
41566:22,"i just remember they had some funny stories,"
84530:21,"at new years, we had some people come in and, uh, like attack one of the planes. because they were protesting, uh, the presence over in the persian gulf."
161183:38,"well, you should, you should have some opinions on that, then."
33345:49,one of the unique things in this it's like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs um an egg um whatever seasonings
50337:29,and what 's wrong is right in some cases.
77264:6,"and some people said to me, well, that's our wintertime."
127761:15,not enough stories with some substance that you can really get into .
118734:78,"and, um, i think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more, that maybe that could solve some of our problems."
20170:26,"there are, were some, uh, regulations  over, i don't know whether they're laws passed or, or whatever they're called  , uh, just recently, where, uh, people with certain diseases can not be excluded , uh, from, uh, immigration ."
61000:7,"and some of the people that  work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming  they, you know, shut down everything and they clean up their act, but on a normal basis that they're, that they're dumping things, that they're not supposed  to be dumping ,"
22992:33,"and then on the other hand, i've seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy you know."
31987:28,"you know, after a while you make some stuff,"
13983:93,"i, i, you know, i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that  could use some help"
19933:5,some of those get very philosophical
48706:4,"some things we can't do ,"
41717:66,"well i feel like too, on the job, when, you know, there's men around and some of the managers are men , you just, you know, you don't want them looking at your legs necessarily."
163234:34,"but i, i do know some of these places were doing that"
16640:26,"i, i like some of his songs, though."
130994:56,"and, i guess he, he did some crazy thing  to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away, type of deal."
156060:102,"well, you also have the very close related thing of the, uh, rain forest destruction which  is the main source of what 's clearing out the atmosphere and replacing some of the pollutants."
18285:38,"in fact, we put in some, uh, some more roses yesterday."
130584:43,"uh, the closest thing i did  was go to some like, uh, restored castles and stuff."
5140:15,and that does take some time.
99355:10,"well, some of them, yes they do"
15261:29,"i think that maybe that's why some people do it  is, uh, to see the other cultures or, you know and some of that."
31317:82,"and while it had, you know, a few little grammatical problems, it wasn't very long and so forth. i thought it had some nice, well thought out, uh, parts to it."
77887:17,"and so the kids in some ways are, are, are suffering a little bit, in that, uh, the model, the role models that  get the, the, the family issues that  get discussed , and all these, i think  are very important parts of them growing up,"
44694:37,"uh, and, and, you know, some people might not believe that"
60034:130,"and then we'll have all, we'll have, we will have the money if we would do that to, to work on your own system because we've got some serious problems here"
88070:6,"and some, people don't even own a car and know how to drive a car ."
146618:32,and then you would see see some of the others that  are were like distant from the other group
132148:16,and there's probably some truth to that.
14769:69,"and what we have  to do  is, we have  to go, uh,  get some stuff, steal it, and then, you know, just resell it."
176780:98,"rodney got beat  up because he, he, you know, he pur-, you know, he involved himself in some sub, self-destructive behavior."
164858:59,"there wasn't as many advanced placement courses , uh, when i was a senior  that some other schools had ."
24802:122,"it's like if, if your father owns a grocery store and you're really interested in that, there's no reason that you should take college prep courses  when you can get some general business courses in high school ."
75949:43,"you can, you know, you can get some of us,"
102005:100,"it, it's, as much as you want, you know torn up and, and rice and cream of chicken soup and some mayonnaise and lemon juice and celery"
43900:8,probably some of them did.
74608:91,"but, uh, that was, that's the extent of which i guess that's more than, than some people, less than others."
79893:26,"i, i have some neighbors across the field,"
63072:28,and then i was having  to work some real late hours  to get caught with my work after i got out of class.
91119:18,so you probably could give some great advice.
135535:24,and then make movies out of some of them.
95835:35,"but out on the line, they've got people working some serious equipment."
47270:33,"i mean, it's just almost surreal, in some places."
95535:14,"she told me some of the things you can do ,"
91184:148,"i, i think i'd, i'd advise a parent  to send a kid to a school , though, that  has a number of different types of programs, you know, that, uh, some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer ,"
20839:32,"and, um, like, um, they also take some things at the flower mound dump behind the fire station there,"
38991:16,"and i've done some of the crewel and the, um something similar to that"
10235:39,unfortunately the rangers don't spread it around quite as big as some of the other teams do.
63221:32,"um, it's a lot more fun than some other things i could do , i guess ."
99831:29,"that's enough to, uh, do some boating"
89352:11,what are some others that you have seen  lately .
56132:85,"uh, or we'll suddenly be in the dark and say, oh, my goodness, now we don't have the ability to go on to some new technology."
45110:199,"and, uh, i do think more needs  to be done  along that line to help to, uh, teach the people, uh, uh, everyone, uh, more about what  is going on with voting and with nonvoting. so that, uh, we can make, they're making some more intelligent decisions."
151536:59,"and, uh, each one of the, everybody that  showed up donated some money for the rent and for, for like soft drinks"
95804:23,there's got  to be some backup to say that
148183:40,i'd like  to go to sundance and park city and some of those.
23641:34,"we got, we got what some people call  the best beef in the world."
173289:7,but some of them are very rich
109255:17,"the second thing is some colleges only offer the, uh, liberal arts and, uh, whereas like state, they offer engineering courses"
101449:50,this is something that  ought  to be in the schools rather than some of the other stuff they do .
115483:40,"i like, i like  to read some of the philosophy stuff."
90144:26,but i do know that there are some wonderful places out there
140818:55,"well, we've heard bad, we've heard some bad things about some of those, you know,"
119111:78,"uh, i just have a feeling that we've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations you know."
20734:50,"they'll help you, recycle, because we, there is some bins, like behind wal-mart, that  take some things."
104694:41,"and there's some, i think there's some good disney movies fixing to come out on video, uh, shipwrecked."
159233:9,"but in some instances you're going  to put companies out of business by  taking that stance, if they have  to take it out of their own retained earnings."
69672:11,they got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests.
160477:87,"and for the longer term i, i read, uh, like scientific american and, and, uh, readers' digest and some of those other types of magazines that  come out which, they,"
16039:6,in some cases
141921:54,"and, uh, i also like  to plant flowers and do do some gardening and do arts and crafts."
2100:38,"um, it takes some, it  takes some dedication to do it,"
124500:45,"my son and i used  to have a bet  going about some of the players that  had moved from here to minnesota,"
108349:80,"so you don't have  to, you don't have  to buy the lot of the wardrobe that some of the people in banking and that kind of thing do ."

169024:29,"uh, i know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders."
177102:83,"and the thing that  just was in the local news bulletin was, somebody has, uh, ter-, made some special, uh, polymers that  have the ability to, uh, make certain actinide elements adhere to them."
24388:44,"i, i thought maybe you might have had some experience with the, uh, r c one thirty-fives."
166817:15,definitely does need some improvements.
121141:6,and some people call them may beetles.
147754:50,"and personally i feel it's probably, there's probably some of each."
30596:33,"i mean, and then of course you have some changes to make , and do the whole thing over."
86408:11,in fact some of the days we froze.
98969:36,"and one thing that you get  if you have some expertise is, uh, you know the range of, of possible values or terms or, you know, how heinous was the crime ."
85235:65,"so it 's kind of hard for me to tell what  would happen if i lived in some of the valleys inland,"
71287:32,"at least what i read , is that some younger people feel that education is priced  out of their, uh, out of their, uh, budget."
23017:54,"but i guess once you get ill, then, you know, you really have some problems if you can't get around and do things."
5480:20,"but, uh, i know some people at t i,"
39130:54,so. i think it  would be nice to just go out and pick some tomatoes off the porch.

132402:20,"well, i know, some people go during lunch,"
13347:160,"well, it seems that there's some things like the, uh, the programs at least just go around and, and, and clean up streets and, and, and pick up trash and even aluminum cans and some of these kinds of things."
74568:22,"and then let them try some innovative things and see what  works. and then, uh, have some sort of mechanism for passing that knowledge along to other teachers who  could benefit from the same sorts of things. and then from the parents' side, have the parents support the school. get involved."
169714:12,and it was some malaria medication
96743:132,"and, uh, uh, i guess my, i, uh, the one, my one bad thing is that i am, that i wish my mother had had some of those opportunities, because, i think she would have really, she rea-, would have succeeded in a lot of ways, that men, that women were not able  to succeed , in her, generation."
158188:98,"it's like they're saying well on the one hand they're not, he's not getting a jury of his peers which  is in some ways i think  true."
76326:14,"i did get some material and studied every bit of material that i could study ,"
175399:7,"even some of the immediate things that i need  to know , i don't know it until the next hour"
32977:37,"it takes a, yeah, it does take some space."
148529:15,"um, i have some spiro gyro tapes."
146710:44,"and i think it is going  to come to that because some people will just not go to the,"
88706:22,"and also, um, i do some work at u t d"
134426:48,"and, uh, we've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato and some blackberries and strawberries."
65927:55,"but i'm just saying that even the differences, uh, is that, you know, some countries pay for students to go to, through college and etcetera."
11353:13,you saved me some money.
115525:57,"and i like  to read, uh, i like  to read some self help books like, uh,"
35085:21,"you know, you watch some of the cartoons,"
15755:34,"i think they may be playing up um, some aspects of the movie that  aren't the main aspects."
66757:23,"there are some, some other crimes that i think, uh, you know, uh,"
29326:35,so here lately with all the middle eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch.
158215:60,"but i, i rather imagine there's, there's some snickering about it. and a lot of the usually fatalistic, uh, here we go again folks, kind of stuff."
138929:40,"so here, i know that, uh, last year there was some ice storms while i was out of the state"
88772:47,"so, um, if you, um, unless you have some other things you want  to talk about  as having  to do with p c"
145945:125,"i guess what, the other benefits that, uh, that i, uh, that i miss , i guess is, uh, you know, some of the bonuses and stuff that that  goes on with just being involved  with a big company, you know"
56003:40,"and i can see, you know, some, some really significant things coming out of it."
2722:7,and some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes
83552:52,"takes a heck of a long time, i guess, to get there in some states."
93005:47,"maybe you saw in the paper this morning that, um, they've had some problems with, the recycling on plastic,"
155471:9,"unfortunately, some elderly have to go to or have, i guess it's  alzheimer's or where they wonder or, or, uh, confused or have some mental problem ."
27147:10,"and consequently some of the very best students were, had excellent memories"
85724:16,"um, there are some areas  though where, where they have a problem with, uh, the houses kind of sinking a little bit into the, to the, uh ,"
56656:83,"um, you don't even have  to go all the way to new orleans, you know, if you want  to really get some good food."
94976:130,"and, um, about, i guess about when the first, when the youngest one was in kindergarten  i started  working at a preschool and, uh, you know, doing some work,"
40694:58,"and he just really missed  being able  to be by himself, and having some peace and quiet"
62767:31,"but to keep her entertained, music and some of these things do help."
96775:40,"so, she is pretty much, although there were some other women in her class, she was, you know, uh, one of the minorities,"
9106:85,"do you, uh, do you think that those are bigger contributors than things like ai-, acid rain and some of the pollutants that  come from, uh, industrial areas, factories and so on."
63816:17,"and they've got some great big bins there for newspaper, um, plastic, um, i think three bins for glass, white, green, and whatev-, whatever other combination there is ."
56198:25,"and you put a bay leaf and put some, uh, red pepper over it."
149162:20,"well, i was doing some of the same stuff, but doing it more slowly, and with smaller files."
101243:85,"and let everyone have an opportunity to reach higher education if they're willing, you know,  to work and have, uh, some ability."
77906:47,"but, uh, i-, it seems that there should be some continuity,"
74032:16,"well, i got some friends that, uh,"
16415:5,"some of them, they used  to be a hundred dollars,"
100975:27,"i'm glad that there are still some areas that, that  get the youth involved  in that sort of thing."
136126:11,"there's some real weird people that, he seems  to come up with ."
36918:34,"i mean some, i think some people that  had fairly sturdy, um, vehicles or whatever if they had like a winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water, i think they stayed."
19697:27,"it was made  to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because, you know, it was, uh, if you read it, it only emancipated those who  were in areas, uh, in rebellion against the united states."
114588:104,"uh, because i, i need  to have it tuned, you know, tuned  up and i don't know, replace some of the belts."
42645:119,"i mean, there are a lot of kids who when they're ten   look like they're twelve, or fourteen or, and, and, especially some of the minority children. whether, you know a racist or not,"
108744:71,"uh, well, it, it's, it's, it really expresses some of the opinions of, of the people who  enjoy the music"
29611:17,and the other one has some weird ones that i've never heard of .
9573:19,and then i've seen some of the star trek movies.
456:25,"um, but still, it gives it some variety."
56809:31,and no one could make heads or tails out of some of them
116582:15,but we've had some pretty nice weather.
32809:15,"and i've got some radishes up,"
69408:35,"oh, there's, there's some nice things in baltimore, you know,"
81885:137,"ninety, i would say about, oh, about ninety-five percent, no i guess may-, probably a hundred percent of them all are mostly brick, uh, with some wood."
15843:18,"now we've let some people  go, uh, that wa-, we, was found that drugs were used  in  their system."
1988:12,"there are some, you know, types of heavy metal that i really like ,"
47420:60,"and i never had  to watch the news not, you know, not like some people hour and a half a day or anything."
14969:33,i guess i've had some good experience and some bad experience with them.
9501:60,"i, i think, in, in some, in some respects it probably mumblex more tolerable."
88719:5,"some of the commands just had nothing to do  with, you know, what you were supposed  to be doing  what they, what they did  on the com-, computer"
36737:8,just some of them are known
67111:45,"and some, some of the people, uh, some of the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too, are picking up some of those great big houses,"
55159:38,"uh, marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes, because of some of the stupid stuff he does ,"
100820:27,"um, but i do know through some organized groups like scouts and church um, they, do still have opportunities."
11992:7,and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback.
147083:36,"um, oh, it, there's some good things about it"
24846:25,"and, you know, there's some kids that, you know,  want  to go  learn,"
126610:15,and they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes
62502:62,"so, we're a little fa-, you know, farther removed from like dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing ."
163528:86,"so, it sounds like you, uh, you think that, that we'd be able  to save some money by, uh  passing the line item veto."
65668:54,"it's, uh, something we're really irritated about  around here. or some people are really irritated about ."
173813:37,"well, when mine were growing up , i did some traveling and but not that extensively"
62707:16,"so, well, actually some things are pretty good with that because i put it on a gold credit card"
90033:32,and i also feel that that's where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from . is when people have  to put people in a nursing homes
27864:37,i usually get to the point where i can play some of my favorite themes
50720:6,"and some people would get civilian, uh, service, like working in hospitals."
139654:36,"my folks and i always had a dog and a cat, some, birds,"
86489:22,what we did  in some of the other cities and they tell you  to do that is to hire a local guide
171199:29,well i think the court systems could stand some improvement.
46328:7,"and some of those people, they don't deserve  to be let  loose."
56053:54,"and i thought i had seen, when we were traveling around the state , some similar signs  up that  indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up"
68757:42,"i, i have, i have some friends who  do expert wis-, witness testimony"
169818:78,"i mean a lot of, a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of  later on"
80629:13,at least maybe some of these mountain bikes you could
30391:38,"we have, you know, used some of it for some personal things."
133358:40,"but i do think that we have  to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five, six grades and just keep  going over and over and over until most of those that  are capable can at least learn  to read and write"
176346:16,"he crashed and killed some people because he was, uh, smoking some marijuana"
67949:38,"well the puppy jumped in the, into some of the pools but not into the,"
74341:4,"some ways it's rather frightening,"
24055:33,"depending upon the field, i know there are some fields which a person should go to the school, that school, all four years ,"
100784:45,"and, uh, i had opportunities in high school, to work in some programs, um"
140921:16,and i'll take some time and do that with her.
36612:7,"and some of them aren't,"
106691:93,"well, um, so to speak, i had  to paint this, uh, the inside of this warehouse thing that you keep some, um, farm equipment in"
3297:34,"that's, that's what some people call like  really heavy metal."
76211:56,"and, so, well, i thought, gee, i've been wanting  to, do some brick, uh, walkways for a time."
40951:7,and some of those other places i wouldn't have.
123714:38,"we're supposed  to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here, uh, which  will be, you know, a little bit more typical, uh, autumn weather."
120517:9,or do some of them play the same song.
8687:12,so she brings some money in.
149148:54,"you know, when you write a test  you have  to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing  and find out which ones  are discriminating well and which ones  aren't find out how reliable the test is ,"
72554:39,"i wish i had in, in some senses"
56203:18,"or you can just get some, you know, regular red peppers."
171344:39,"but i found that, uh, it was made  of some material which  actually ended up  rusting uh, after,"
42149:6,"some of these plea bargains and all this kind of stuff that they do , it's just, it just gets out of hand,"
149427:7,and some of the weirdest animals you ever want  to see  in there.
76809:59,"it 's amazing how the, you know, people you talk to  have some interesting conversations"
130776:48,"and, uh, so, you know, if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings, anything that they can pass  on to the consumer, you know,"
28335:95,"some of the, some of the women's roles, i think , are almost for the worse, because we're losing out on some things,  going back to work,"
119144:63,"and uh,, you know, of course i, i'm sure we have some enemies down there who  wouldn't care what  happened to us,"
145454:30,"i mean, there are sort some inherent limits there,"
120178:18,"um uh, well, some of both."
161045:13,"well, because some people, uh, want  to train them as,"
176324:16,"and i've got some very definite, uh, opinions about it . uh, you know, which  haven't changed all that much from my first reactions from, from when they, when they announced it . but, uh, developed a little more, i guess, but haven't changed that much."
132933:57,some of the cars that i got  were like the toyota camry and the nissan maxima and some of the competitors
32071:143,"and, uh, so, and, uh, so as far as, you know, planting outdoor stuff, matter of fact, tonight i just got through, i was planting some, some trees out back tonight,"
117836:27,"or uh, you know, you got some cartoons"
45071:17,and this candidate tells you some things.
144511:39,"but, uh, uh, i know that, uh, in some of these larger cities they're passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing to prevent, you know, so that, uh, the drug addicts won't be getting dirty needles and everything."
155201:43,we're trying  to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that
164110:55,"i think that we're going  to be, uh, owning a mini van for some years  to come."
36600:32,"and we were hoping, uh,  to do some camping in the van, um,"
158261:43,"she, she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the, with the owner of the store."
19223:138,"and, you know, i even had a thought  once that the whole iraqi thing might have been just a, a deal  to go ahead and let us, uh, you know, expend some, some military hardware."
16220:4,"some people like swiss, um,"
53626:13,we're getting some flooding.
106658:65,"i had  to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go  buy some paint thinner, and mumblex and everything like that,"
142965:19,"actually now you can get some really good deals  flying over,"
70200:18,"well, we could use some rain up here."
145917:27,"because i looked into  picking up some, uh, medical insurance for my, just for my family, you know, just,"
24771:51,"well, that's really too bad because it, it's giving some people unfair advantage."
158370:21,"this child was crying and needed some comfort, you know,"
139739:24,you sound like you've got some small ones in the background.
11328:16,"but i would buy some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids,"
39986:52,"they didn't have, they didn't have  to go through some tough games during the year"
72763:7,"and some of the people, uh,"
120873:46,"and of course we were close enough that we could go back and get some more blankets and things in the morning,"
101464:11,"so, in some ways i think  the, the day schools do serve those purposes."
50370:29,"i, i think some of these people that they claim  as middle eastern experts don't, don't have a clue sometimes."
77461:30,"what's, what are some other questions they have  ,"
65454:12,"does he get some royalties from that, hopefully."
1638:23,"i think there is still some discrimination there where as, you know, men and women work in the same job ,"
13469:7,"but some of them are sold ,"
159263:34,"and if, if they know some practice is wrong, you know,"
37224:9,but in some ways i think we are expected  to do it all.
160595:7,"and some of it, i mean, is,"
152067:55,"unless you, unless you have some vacation time or some, some sick leave or whatever, um, you kind of have  to finagle your way around  to get that time."
14724:29,"and he said, sign up and get some money and just talk for five minutes."
81802:32,"and it's a brick house, with, uh, some wood."
42132:18,"the same thing goes with some of these insanity pleas, you know."
32704:46,"when we had our pool done   i had them to leave some extra loam, you know, for my garden"
55947:53,"you take pride in that, and, and get some, some positive feedback from those  who  benefit, besides yourself."
103477:18,"but i know in some areas, it's really, it, it really is bad."
74537:12,so i have some rather strong opinions.
130755:109,"what, what  really works, uh, at least down here is, if there is, if there is some, e-, even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it  , you know what i mean , then people tend  to do it."
147237:51,"but i think, uh, we're going  to have  to make some fundamental changes"
63913:49,"and i think they're trying  to, to make some changes."
83449:21,"uh, i know in some cases now in some states, depending on the criminal code, uh, a unanimous verdict is not required ."
113277:12,"and we had some wonderful, wonderful years there under roger staubach."
55284:85,"there's probably five or six, which  would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs, that  are in positions over some of these soviet states."
169890:62,"we used  to go once a month, once every two months  to visit some of the patients there."
146950:24,"so  to be taller than some of the boys in the bigger grades, uh, older grades, i had  to wear heels."
6720:24,"really there could be, um, some scandals involved, if, you know, it wasn't people that  were really fair and le-, you know, in a legal way or something,"
134199:41,"i think it's mostly vehicles although it does come from some of the industry of, of the gary area"
71923:14,because i work some weird hours and do some traveling.
103788:26,but you know i guess to some people it 'd almost be better  to die to them than to spend life in prison or whatever
138873:64,"seems to me i remember that, uh, i was hired , came in and went through some orientation"
46965:16,"but supposedly they have some real wood built in to like the clutch and all this and the steering wheel,"
121757:84,"if i was having a dinner party i would probably, um, have some, um, some, uh, um, some fruit to start with  with some apples sliced up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and, um, probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some, uh, uh, salsa and chips  around and peanuts."
141886:24,"you know, i mean, some topics,"
126632:62,"sometimes i wish we'd help them out instead of  going all across the world, and helping some countries i never even heard of ."
164368:12,"well, for some things."
146901:15,"because i had some appointments at the office  today, some interviews"
153747:33,"i guess, i guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled"
59652:37,and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems.
92531:11,"there were some people at the next table who  spoke english,"
99256:22,"and you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools, like history at clark, they're all pretty fancy."
99637:89,"and i'm, you know, showing them if you're strong in math and science, kiddos, this is one area where women can make some decent money . you know."
71222:34,"to g-, to give you some perspective, this, this town that i had lived in  for sometime in nineteen eighty-three was funded  sixty-five per cent by state funds."
44033:5,"some of the home builders are,"
89480:63,"they say if you really want  to be, uh, you really want some suspense, that's the one to see ."
72128:34,"the, uh, the, some of the nautilus equipment that i started  seeing  at the one that we used  to go to  was really interesting,"
99356:32,"and, and it's not at some of the private schools,"
134420:23,we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders.
131277:37,"so, uh, it  would be kind of exciting in some ways to, to see a little bit more of that"
55219:110,"and my reasons are based  upon not only from what i read  in the newspapers, what i see  on the newspapers, but up against some of the, fun and exciting things i ran into  during my six years as a soldier in the fifth special forces group."
174196:39,"when i was, a couple of years ago, involved in some pretrial stuff  and"
31080:59,"in some of those, you know, they, i guess they retitled some movies that  were going  to be about lebanese and, and, you know, and, and americans"
121757:134,"if i was having a dinner party i would probably, um, have some, um, some, uh, um, some fruit to start with  with some apples sliced up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and, um, probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some, uh, uh, salsa and chips  around and peanuts."
16054:41,"i mean, and they have, they have some serious chemicals out there you know,"
45036:13,"and you have some success and want  to go on  learning and continue  learning, uh and not wait until they're in high school"
39408:26,"and then i mix up, uh, some cream cheese and a little bit of amaretta wi-, and some cool whip,"
175669:10,"and for some of them it was just kind of, i don't know, not so much a holiday,"
16349:60,"i think the, uh, actually i think they get, um, some of them from south america."
32983:19,"mumblex and i've got some tomatoes still growing, in, in containers,"
60699:26,"and, and that has some opportunities"
3798:43,"and, uh, there's, uh, there's some petting, you know, like, uh, uh,"
113855:35,"and i don't mind, uh,  paying for some of these fringe benefits that people are entitled to ."
62647:7,in some ways it has more  to do with the people who  sold it.
29410:26,"and, and they shed some light on what  was going on for me."
51582:32,"and, um, it had been recommended  by some friends of ours"
80681:23,and i've been  buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways to paint .
29180:50,"then it comes down to what you said  before though about them being some of the lowest paid public, you know, public service, employees that there are ,"
44939:18,and people are finally taking some action against it.
152280:24,"i mean, you know, some people had been there a long time."
133228:13,i certainly have some ideas since i'm studying it now in college.
38919:40,"i've, i've, uh, made some small things, cross stitch things."
55078:22,in a way aikman has done some of that.
145692:12,and they took some rooms down at a holiday inn
91041:57,"but, then again, uh, well, i, you know, i have some aunts that, uh, i, i, i do ."
165687:30,"and i found that while you can find some cars that  are comfortable to ride in , uh, finding a ca-, car  anymore that 's, that 's fairly easy for me to work on , it's just not very eas-, it's not very,"
164091:22,"and it's, uh, got some nice features in terms of being able  to remove seats and flip them around"
146619:59,"and they they just didn't like participate together with the others because they had some some, uh, i guess, uh, slight mental disabilities and things like that."
76377:93,"if they have problems with, uh, sand bugs of some kind i think  all they need  to do  is probably  put some insecticide down in there on a, oh, a fairly regular basis, for a while anyway."
96882:42,"but i just would rather have, uh, a man  doing some of these jobs than a woman."
177105:58,"uh, uh, they've, uh, looked at, uh, plutonium and uranium and, uh, some other similar things  to try  to remove those from radio active waste"
29208:96,"goodness gracious, if we would, uh, plan our expressways a little better, that ten dollars for the bridges and the roads, we'd cut that in half and get some teachers"
51340:81,"you know, i kind of wish that they had inter league play, like they do in all the other sports so i could see some of the national league teams here once in a while."
171678:13,they've had some serious problems in the past couple of years.
62101:38,and just recently i've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing.
27683:75,"but the, the interesting thing is that paint we wound up  having  to go back and scrape some of that away"
155563:20,"uh, guy, uh, some of my things, i, i'd like  to have a short work week you know,"
166903:55,"matter of fact, i've heard that, i've heard that some of the information , uh, is prevented  from  reaching the jury, like, uh, mitigating circumstances or, or preceding, uh, criminal record or things of this nature that,"
49908:42,and every once in a while gets a chance to talk to some of the guys
27803:45,"uh, and i think even electric light orchestra had some, some real, um, influences by classical music"
159358:7,and some of the really nice ones that  really take care of their people are so expensive. because cause they can afford  to hire the people that  are really going to care for the older.
26735:64,"and, and that way,  handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it."
87257:107,"and they were just really coming down on him because of some of the things he was, just some of the things that he believed in , some of his morals."
71184:87,"so tho-, those are two areas in which t i stands  to, to gain some, some short term business  to restock that ."
38978:27,and i thought i better  do some simple things and work up to this because it  was just so difficult to get it done .
62192:35,"but i've, i've got some opinions on it."
155746:10,"i know some senators,"
19045:21,"and i've seen where some places have taken a plastic  and, uh, they're recycling them into other plastics. and the styrofoam also into insulation and things like that"
22657:23,we'll try  to catch some crab.
117808:33,"and, uh,  seeing as you've got some older children, i, i'm wondering, how did you handle that , when they were growing up ."
46373:50,"sometimes when you lose someone that you really love  , you do some crazy things"
134176:40,"and we'll let them try  to drink out of some of the lakes and try  to fish in some of the lakes that  have been suffering from, uh, the, uh, acid rain"
62581:54,"well, we bought a computer because my husband needed  to use it to do some work for a consulting project,"
46609:15,"and especially not in some of these big cities,"
159138:19,"and, uh, granted some people need  to be compensated  if they have really been wronged , you know."
165858:16,"some, some local communities are very active in that, uh, in that respect"
108737:78,"and, uh, a lot of it is, has a lot  to say , or some of it has a lot  to say ,"
141287:39,"there is one cousin out in colorado, uh, uh, some cousins over in phoenix, uh,"
25273:85,"well, um, oh, i guess another thing i've noticed , too, here lately is that even though we've had some pretty warm days, it's been awfully gray, you know, just,"
109067:18,"marinated in olive oil and some seasoning, um, and cooked with some olives and some, and some prunes, uh,"
46446:10,"uh, some of those countries were so safe, it was unreal."
55919:15,"it gave some folks some jobs,"
120922:61,"but by then, of course, i was able  to catch, uh, catch some things,"
94182:13,must be some italian spices in there.
65357:5,"some of those books are real tough to get into ,"
166453:10,that's some brutal stuff there.
83497:27,"plus, i guess, there was some credit for time this guy had already spent in jail waiting for trial ."
27330:65,"i remembering  reading a few cases about that when it, when some people first tried that"
124653:71,"it's hurting, you know, it's hurting germany , for example, too, and some other parts of europe where they, where they have high industry ."
79030:34,"they have  to kind of take a stand on some things, like abortion and things like that,"
88662:24,ours really needs  to have some work done  on it
147291:12,"and they needed some quality care,"
168982:36,"and, you know, for some, for some young men, that's good."
99158:38,"but, you don't know, uh, i guess at some of the other schools you go to  unless you've been there."
60662:8,"but some of the internal news and the news services,"
174570:7,in some ways i don't like it because it's like they're playing god.
12596:58,"i mean, i'd like  to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region"
19295:81,"well, this would be like if somebody was elected  president of the united states and suddenly took off toward, you know, just some pretty hard by the socialism,"
37349:44,"i, well i see, i think  some people wanting  to stay home more and take care of the children."
90039:83,"and, uh, they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home who  had, had, uh, apparently inhaled some chicken he was eating ."
119945:93,"and i think that certainly makes a difference from, back from the time when somebody handcrafted something  and, you know, had some pride in it ."
76200:18,"they, uh, auctioned some tools and, things like that,"
4528:7,and some of them fizzled out
109269:7,"well some schools may even give you financial aid, where another one won't ."
171919:19,"we do some cooking, some barbecueing, have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the patriots lose and then go home and eat, drink some more."
106619:25,"and the second one was i bought some toys at a, um, at a craft fair."
64610:17,"and they've built some new highways out to that area, and things, lately."
109067:39,"marinated in olive oil and some seasoning, um, and cooked with some olives and some, and some prunes, uh,"
168555:17,"like i said, some years ago, i think i would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the, civilized western country."
151108:23,"it was, yeah, in some of the critical things, like the off-, special investigations, at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person,"
53602:9,"uh, some real massive thunderstorms."
146225:40,"so i had, i went and bought just some cloth glue and glued it all back"
148889:35,"got that, uh, uh, some insight  there,  to, to kind of help me put together the feelings."
15068:10,compared to some of the other ones.
27799:10,"chicago had some things,"
13424:44,"and in fact, some of these things i get , some of these questionnaires,"
143722:15,"but i know some people can get, get, you know, carried  away with them and let them get out of hand."
33859:9,"there some things i'd like  to try ,"
156639:7,"but some of them have already been in youth centers. and that kind of thing,"
91758:36,"and he really, this man really shed some light on, um, some, aspects of of bach's genius and, and, and, you know, the, and more sociological things, you know, like the, the idea that, um, that music, to be a musician was as much, um, of a family occupation as anything."
82295:13,"they were doing some, uh, ozone testing, and, uh, th-, the e p a"
171693:31,"and it recently was sold  to, uh, some other people"
73140:10,"and then some of them add late fees on it, if they don't get paid"
72160:27,"just to do, you know, some bicep, tricep exercises."
135551:31,"so she couldn't possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers,"
155436:87,"if my parents were  to get ill, i would like  to take care of them at home and if i had the money with some help."
31180:170,"and, uh, you know, i, i've, in hindsight, seen some things that i wished that, you know, i had done something about  that  was, you know, within my power or, uh, you know, wish that in some ways we, as parents, had more control over what 's happening up there, you know, type thing."
90848:29,"and it was not only in mississippi, in some other places, as well,"
22932:13,now there is some really nice ones.
94526:45,"and we found that if it's in a certain part of texas, some people come,"
127169:7,"and some of these mini skirts, you know, are worse than shorts ever thought about  being."
48532:18,"once you get into some of the programs that  are out now, you can do so much  with them, that you don't do  until you really make yourself use them."
6397:25,"but there's going  to be some negatives anywhere, you know, no matter where you go ."
23861:102,"and if you like chinese food, you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it and chop some scallions and a little ginger and just cover it with some, uh, waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done,"
10895:45,"well as, it, as i recall it got some academy awards, didn't it."
91758:53,"and he really, this man really shed some light on, um, some, aspects of of bach's genius and, and, and, you know, the, and more sociological things, you know, like the, the idea that, um, that music, to be a musician was as much, um, of a family occupation as anything."
138037:56,"i think we need  to get back to the, show some respect"
176628:53,"i i built it  two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and, uh, a backrest and all that stuff."
95400:23,"um, well, i actually do some work,  working at m i t and at nist, national institute of standards and technology in washington,"
9584:73,"when i, when i started  thinking about this , that those are some of my favorite shows,"
64564:10,they have some pretty nice weather out there in los angeles.
50235:53,"and, and, and i don't have any doubt that through some back channels that we encouraged it. you know."
142141:14,"i have got some of those too,"
37283:73,"but, uh, even now, i would, i would like  to not have  to work in some ways."
43642:11,what are some other ones i've seen  lately .
77358:19,"and, um, did some shopping and stuff."
108972:69,"and it consisted of, of grilled kielbasa sausage uh, a potato salad with olive oil, and uh, some tomatoes that  had been chopped  up with onions and curry powder"
164404:48,"but, then, you know, i think that, that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment. you know, just, like, for example, uh, you know, you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who  abused them"
100571:7,"and some of them, i think  unconsciously do it, you know, as a just, you know, half seni-,"
94747:14,there have been some really wild shows put on there.
146612:75,"well, it is like, wel-, the one that i worked in , uh, you would see some of them just like in wheelchairs all day,"
55919:10,"it gave some folks some jobs,"
8930:19,"so, those things they take some time to make ."
147582:28,"and it 's just too bad that some people, you know, still look down on them just because of their color. you know."
92716:8,"just some of the times they're continued ,"
104230:49,"it's kind of haunting, you know, on, on some of the notes."
115742:25,"i, i do some things."
96261:16,and i can take some real great tours to europe.
118309:83,"that's, y-, count your blessings because uh, it really is good when someone can do some things to a car themselves ."
83449:32,"uh, i know in some cases now in some states, depending on the criminal code, uh, a unanimous verdict is not required ."
2767:14,"i've done some of the other speech programs,"
134101:49,"uh, the state of wisconsin, as a matter of fact, uh, started some litigation against illinois because of the air pollution we were getting ."
81929:47,"an, and while, while there are some advantages to that, there's less time spent outside making it look nice and taking care of things."
149485:72,"and especially in this election year, i think that, uh, there ought  to be so-, at least some conversation about what we are supposed  to do  about this."
13411:17,"and that is that some of the organizations sell their mailing lists which i think  is a, is an invasion of privacy."
110398:27,"i found when i did do some work  when my son was young , it was like contract work,"
32577:41,"next year i was planting some broccoli and, and some of those, they're called  cabbage,  cabbage loppers, or whatever."
83198:48,"if you don't refute it, as he didn't, there must be some truth to the matter, see."
74301:11,"i see some flickers of, of, uh, of good directions turning,"
9608:21,he took a car battery and some wire and two washers one time and made a welder.
160993:10,"there are some smart ones out there,"
140815:71,"you know, maybe you nee-, you can get it signed  up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes."
31489:41,"on the other hand, um, i think there's certainly some professions that  ought  to be tested  because of the, of their responsibility for the public welfare, and certainly people in, uh, industries, well, the transportation industry, for spe-, uh, you know, specifically."
43407:11,i know some friends who  went  to see it.
161619:23,i'd like  to do some sailing.
121023:37,"saint augustine, uh with a little bermuda mixed in in some of the sunny areas"
113475:14,"we drive by some houses  everyday that  have big signs,"
31254:36,and i would imagine their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases.
108975:9,and probably some yogurt was in there.
74324:8,"and, some people just don't have it."
171296:110,"but, the thing is too, maybe they need more of a, i don't know, more of a expert types to, to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick, you know, joe blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever an-, and call them in."
129004:16,"but, did they have some pretty good special effects."
55311:27,"but on a highly populated area, like some of the soviet cities would be, with the weaponry that 's attached  on those things, there is no place to hide ."
136180:24,"i mean, we still have some highways closed ,"
31917:13,"and we made some really nice christmas wreaths with, uh, dried red flowers and dried white flowers and, uh, eucalyptus."
73173:67,"so, they've got quite a bit more motivation i think  to get paid  then, some of the others do."
142828:81,"and i think you're probably right, that they, that they need some, you know, some changes in, uh, pitching coach, maybe"
19999:14,"um, well, some history, books are pretty scary,"
99236:8,"because some of the teachers i know  wear, uh, dress up jeans, not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they've had  dry cleaned  so they have got the crease"
14637:17,"and then they're some sections kind of in the corner areas,"
49551:24,"and it had some, some nice features."
16318:47,"and they, they mumblex they go  melt some chocolate chips,."
80333:17,"you know, how some older women will get the big bulge right in the middle ."
90230:11,"he had some accomplices that  were kind of suspect,"
156650:7,"and some of them are our problems,"
7285:11,i made some afghans and that kind of stuff.
136539:14,"i mean, some nights it's just real, real quiet."
115490:21,"and even like reading some new age things, things that i don't quite believe in ,"
67466:21,they want  to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour.
73538:38,"i think that might be part of the problem with some people. you know,"
80218:50,"and i, when i'd gotten back  i had gotten some sun that day,"
89180:32,"i, i was involved in some, uh, oh, alumnae recruiting, uh, here in town, uh, recently, uh, well last year."
6607:30,"because from what i understand , from some of the guys i know , you know, crime, uh, is punishable, just almost, uh, instantly and public,"
2180:39,"so we have, both of us have some money in an i r a that we're also trying  to figure ,"
138349:36,"but i kind of, i liked it some ways"
57069:61,"and, uh, he makes a very, uh, passionate, good argument for why you don't want some things decided  by democratic process ,"
167037:72,"uh, but, if that's the case, if the business is responsible for  policing themselves, then i think some well defined mechanisms need  to be in place so that, uh, the opportunity f-, to forget that you owe sales tax for something, uh, can be avoided ."
15021:56,"i've, i've talked to some who 's really had some bad experience"
136110:19,i think he has some interesting things on it.
37846:61,"not if you can read or write, or do, or un-, understand some science."
84152:34,so i just cut the leaves off and transplant and put some other plants down. because i want them to come back up next year.
156896:23,"i think i've seen some statistics that  say that, uh, it 's more expensive  to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life."
23994:24,use the same hoi sin sauce and some of the frozen mixed vegetables.
152067:34,"unless you, unless you have some vacation time or some, some sick leave or whatever, um, you kind of have  to finagle your way around  to get that time."
105043:10,"i got some good recipes from them sometimes,"
96042:48,"i mean it was, it was just almost laughable in some instances that, you know,"
126455:10,"uh, some of that unfortunately is legal."
172225:11,"i have some games , of course, which i play  on there"
63417:44,and i think they're working on  building a jogging track and some other things.
137794:5,some of these muddy driveways could use it around here.
99291:5,"some of those male coaches, that might really,"
39753:27,"cause, we have some, some local ones."
130514:28,"and i mostly went to germany and visited some friends of my family and, uh, hung out with them, worked a bit on one of their farms and also went to a youth camp."
164352:16,i think in some cases it  doesn't matter if it's a deterrent or not.
56072:31,"and they, they've started some recycling campaigns that  a year before that had been turned down  because they said, well, it's not feasible,"
119842:10,"we bought some walkie-talkies a couple of years ago for christmas,"
157934:65,"well, i do think with working parents it is, i mean, there are some real issues here. um, that i think, um,"
14969:24,i guess i've had some good experience and some bad experience with them.
145536:63,"i, in fact, i've, i've even, uh, heard some people that  have applied for credit cards with much less, uh rates and have paid off their, you know higher interest rate, uh cards and just sent them back, you know."
24962:14,"in, uh, some places, uh, you couldn't go to a public school."
146198:134,"well, one thing that i like  about this fabric painting thing is i can just make a t shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then, um, cut out a little pattern  from the material, from some material, like flowers or something, and make, um, a design or, you know, a little arrangement or something on the shirt and, you know, fuse it on with heat and bond, or whatever and then paint around it."
123419:8,and some paper or something in the super dome up in the roof caught on fire.
120455:28,"and they had, uh, some names, some companies that  sold mustang parts,"
92861:25,"and i guess maybe there are some parts of that,"
84205:26,"the blooms  are, on some of them is yellow, purple, white. just all different colors."
27780:99,"but when i do play, uh, and begin  to reacquire skills  i inevitably fall in love with country western music which  tends  to be in some ways easy to play  for a, for a new piano player."
112989:20,"but, but some people don't have a choice."
134228:135,"but, i, um, tend to all the, planting the annuals and, and the spraying and, um,  taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in, you know, throughout that season, and later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and, um, any kind of decorating for the holidays, you know,"
155148:17,we could talk about some of the long range goals
77309:26,"what do you think  are some current trends in, uh, the way families spend time together , based on what you've seen ."
158550:31,"and it must have reflected, uh, uh, some awful good, uh, diplomacy on the part of the u s."
78394:33,"i've become very aware of different political views because some of the things we have  to discuss  are very politically motivated or whatever,"
108182:40,i guess you have  to take some things and leave some things.
168217:7,"and some of it, sometimes it's serious"
57861:27,"um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that i know  now, i, i'm not sure i do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives."
88001:41,"that would provide, uh, possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things, see."
149669:184,"um, what  really bothers me is it just seems like if, if anyone were  to say, you know, well i'm going  to raise taxes and cut the budget and we're mumblex, we're going  to have  to do some unpopular things, i mean, he wouldn't have a chance of getting elected ."
73755:84,"people are being a little more, oh, i don't know, a little le-, a little less bigoted in some ways,"
113957:66,"man our cr-, our, uh, prisons are so crowded that, uh, they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be set  free within a year to two."
35674:29,and so she's going  to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try  to make as much down payment as possible  to keep the monthly payment low.
134169:64,"maybe to you and i who  have grown up in some in, uh, uh, some more beautiful parts of the country, uh, i think that, that, uh, we become a little more aware , uh, rather quickly of, of what 's happening with air pollution and how, uh, how horrible it really is ."
164073:37,"and we weren't aware of it, and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car,"
165280:27,well it sounds like you've had some good experiences with that
106437:19,but i think that at some times it can be the right thing to do
14653:39,"and i went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets, because a lot of those doctors have season tickets,"
169898:50,"do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with , that the people who  operate it seem  to have, what you'd perceive of  as genuine concern."
166634:38,"oh, here's  an easy way to make some money ."
98932:25,"that, those are some important points."
166971:48,"um, s-, s-, naturally some, some things you just can't find  in your local k-mart or, or, uh, bryn mawr stereo dealer."
6395:54,"well, you know, t i, you know, t i offers some good stuff"
24421:69,"and it, and if it's possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some people do it."
30438:27,"and, you know, it's got some stuff on it."
165750:14,"i've driven some, uh, tauruses  over the last couple of years when i've been on business trips . uh, as rental cars."
46244:16,"some, some places do have guard gates that you have  to get through , or electronic access gates and things like that."
15261:95,"i think that maybe that's why some people do it  is, uh, to see the other cultures or, you know and some of that."
89580:13,and i enjoy some of the michael j. fox movies.
137317:74,"do they still have the, uh, the scenic, uh, roadways that  cut through the center of some of those trees."
3226:17,"like, give me some examples."
94280:31,"for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some, um, tomato sauce in it,"
96724:27,"so, there are some, some strides  to be made  there."
171931:87,"that you miss   sitting home in your parlor, you know, uh, with, with a six pack of beer and some, uh, potato chips, you know"
48103:10,they need some attention.
38063:54,"it's basically just data entry and running, you know, some, some software"
29177:102,"they need  to put some sternness back into the, into the teachers and let them be able  to, uh, get the old whip out and get some discipline."
40705:25,"we all need that time, just some quiet time  to wind down from the day ."
6414:31,"uh, i can see some, some potential changes that  probably are, are, would not cost very much but might, uh, make things a little easier. such as offering a, a smorgasbord. having a larger variety of benefits"
166085:182,"and then, sometimes i, i often, uh, find that maybe there's so many different things available to us. yo-, a microwave, a v c r, a answering machine a, you know, a special, a dishwasher, uh, a refrigerator and some of those items, um, for the, for the, uh,"
138155:36,and i kind of drew up some simple plans to make some book shelves
85965:39,"and, and, uh,, i think some different things  could come from what 's happened , than what we expect ."
38581:37,but that has a little bit  to do with some of the things that i read .
27808:28,i find it  very interesting that some television shows that i enjoy  i particularly like the music.
159110:25,"and i think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous, you know, like millions and millions of dollars."
138174:28,"and, uh, sounds like you got some real nice tools, too."
171967:54,"i, i kind of agree with that, because i think in some cases, uh, the jury may not even have, the information about other crimes the person has committed ."
53690:14,"you've got some kids that 'll pick up on it in the first three minutes you're talking about it ,"
25010:18,"uh, we also have some two year college."
8884:22,so i guess i get some of both.
82021:22,"um, we've actually had some warnings in, uh, raleigh uh, on air pollution."
138291:137,"i'd, i'd kind of like  to, to look at equipment like a lathe or like you say, a table saw and some of those things that  would make, uh, some pretty nice, uh, pieces of, uh, well, wood, for, for different things for tables, for, for, uh, chairs, for, you know, decks and so forth"
74560:83,"and then i would provide, uh, use the money that we've paying them   to, uh, provide some special help in training and particularly, uh, mentor teachers  to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who  may have been at it a long time but have been making the same mistakes for a long time."
19161:75,"the evidence is that, uh, you know, he's, he's let some, some stuff  go, you know, the east german situation."
106391:27,this is going  to give me some more places to go .
24959:32,"maybe we do, we need some more catholic schools,"
85193:35,"likewise, we, uh, we do some projects every now and then."
121941:10,"they have some delicious, delicious things,"
147067:15,"i know that some of the schools they have, uh, country western day or something like that one, you know, or tacky day,"
143578:37,"you must see kids with real significant problems, uh, in some cases."
123812:31,"uh, it, there's some trees like the oaks,"
167299:10,they had some property there
103701:14,"we'll have some interesting discussion, i guess ."
69750:37,"so you ha-, you have been to some family reunions, perhaps."
121775:50,"um, maybe some rolls and, um, i guess  some, uh, some rice or something like that."
24421:47,"and it, and if it's possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some people do it."
83966:23,it was starting  to burn some oil.
157049:37,"well, i, i think on some of it, you have  to say someone's responsible for his actions."
46132:24,"if you get  to watch some of these,"
108856:37,"you can't understand what they're saying  on some of those songs which  probably is just as well on some of them, too."
37616:97,"it seems that what you really need  to do   to win though, is to have a team that  has reasonable talent and has some people that  have, have, have real breakthrough years."
147613:4,some people say oh the boys shouldn't have  to do those jobs. the inside jobs.
174455:135,"the only commitments that they're interested in  making  or even talking about  are ones for flash value like, uh, the trip to mars. which  is, would, would produce some useful scientific research and so forth,"
7265:10,"we did some remodeling when we bought a house ,"
99956:17,"christmas time, uh, some of our relatives would come up from alabama,"
170937:25,"and they finding, in some cases they're finding it 's just not worth it to work because it's all going out in daycare."
8865:67,but one of the things that i do  when i've got some spare time  is i do some woodworking.
58800:5,"some of the stuff is good,"
116197:36,"uh, there are supposed  to be, uh, some people f-, moving down here from colorado springs for t i."
109040:25,"we, we had some friends over as recently as saturday night"
74797:57,"i measured it one time, because i was, uh, we had saw some termites"
7091:13,"and, then, some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find, you know, one day they find, wow, i didn't realize i had this much, you know, i'd spent this much money."
148456:26,"i, i like some of it, um,"
142083:38,"some, uh, you know, i have some good shots and some bad shots."
57651:63,"i'm convinced that the small v eight like the, the mustang's original two eighty-nine or some of the chevy two eighty-threes, were good little v eight engines that  were not gas guzzlers"
7526:63,the elections where they have that topic  seem  to be a little bit better  attended than some of the other ones.
68658:19,"but, if there are some people who  don't agree uh, then there must be, it seems  to be there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people."
16570:13,"and, um, some people don't like that, that, film on the pudding"
8867:13,"and i made some, um, candle sconces that you hang  on the..."
125063:17,"and then, um, some other credit cards, like store credit cards, you know, i do have them up there a little bit,"
121793:56,"you know, i want to, i want  to throw some charcoal on the grill and, and throw a steak  on there and some baked potatoes and stuff like that"
154774:35,"and i think that keeps a lot, some people from  exercising."
87654:69,"i guess some of the best things i've ever had , um, i, some of them were just hors d'oeuvres, you know."
62771:99,"and i thought well, if i had, uh, a nic-, a nice little, um, tape recorder, you know, so that i could put some good music on in there for her every once in a while. and then also so that i can, uh, uh, copy, uh, parts off, i, i do some musicals and things like this and if i can copy sections off that i can use  someplace so i figured well this will be good."
163289:195,"and i, i guess i'll do this for, i was doing this for, actually, i was going  to do it for my son so that he could, uh, he, he's in high school, so that he could make some money."
37263:24,"i mean, i've done some of both."
32953:43,"and i've got some broccoli, uh, onions some, some radishes and, uh, uh, beets."
23634:28,i imagine in argentina you've got some great foods.
108521:93,"uh, lot of the shows that, that i've liked  in the past, like, uh, oh, golden girls and, some of them tend  to get so risque,"
67780:49,"and the dog was being house sit , or dog sit , whatever, by some friends of mine down the street,"
168606:48,"not so much because, uh, it's bad per se, although there is some pretty crappy programming"
27798:15,but he does have some things.
120747:13,something giving you some affection as well.
47856:7,"and some of them don't,"
114202:81,"and, uh, they, they promote service on the part of the kids to, to, uh, some of those people."
23630:11,what are some of your favorite foods .
87467:20,"uh, she can't eat some cream cheese."
168976:57,"and they, they at least have, now they have at least some marginally marketable skills and more discipline."
166762:101,"because, uh, i th-, you know, i think for a lot of people it really is the decision of, do they still have some of their life left."
123797:41,"i was up, i was up there cutting some firewood this weekend,"
63076:40,and then i went to colorado springs the next week  to do some training at the t i up there.
54840:11,"how about some of the ads,"
18547:110,"my, my wife and i, we planted on the, on the south side of our, of our house we planted some gardenias."
7017:34,"well the, the other thing some people are not aware of , is they will use their a, their credit card like their visa or their mastercard for cash"
65258:45,"and i hope we, hope we did them some good, uh, on their little computer dealy."
15216:13,"like i do some volunteer work here and there,"
13420:11,"i get some of these things  in the mail that i wonder, where in the world did they get my address  or where did they get my name  ."
80877:63,so you really don't have  to be disrupted for more than about a weekend. if you have some help.
38947:33,"i was, i was making some little things for christmas,"
154517:48,"and, uh, i was kind of interested  to hear cause they had some people from the e p a and lots of different places"
105338:42,"uh, some people just, uh, i've heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel it's an invasion of privacy and things like that,"
36611:16,"um, up here some of the state parks are really nice"
22419:43,you didn't get a big kick out of  killing them like some people do.
54865:37,"so, we're probably going  to like rent those some time and then try  to see godfather part three somewhere."
171972:37,"uh, i, i think that in some cases that's considered  to prejudice the current case"
82503:72,"um, i, i was taking a voice i o class and, um, and actually doing some research,"
170188:22,we actually do some work with some people down at georgia tech.
19360:7,"and some of the countries that  were forced  in at th-, later dates is the three baltic countries, you know,  came in, in the forties,"
77593:15,what  are some of the things that you did  with your children when they were growing up .
166799:28,"at least, i mean i think some nursing homes do that."
17008:76,"i mean, pretty much a lot of people would know about it, you know, and, and know some of the different things about it"
118769:33,"i've, i've heard some horrible, horrible stories about high, high school teachers"
148372:13,and i like some of their songs.
83450:9,"and indeed some juries are no longer twelve people,"
30439:48,"it's got a nice little word processing software on it, you know, and some budgeting type things and stuff."
46441:47,"i went to the far east, uh, back in october  to do some training for t i"
9762:24,even in for kids watching some of it can be a little violent sometimes and stuff.
163122:31,"i think at each wal-mart, they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that, which  now,"
106565:53,"well that's, yeah, that's right that the children have some responsibility   too, to their parents and such, to help decide what s the right thing."
154338:10,i like some country music.
138340:30,"i mean i'm sure there's some good ones,"
19284:42,"and i think he's actually, honestly trying  to do some change."
98822:22,"well, th-, some of that,"
18087:40,i haven't watch any other ones on t v. just on some of the tapes.
103868:139,"i mean, i'm, i'm not saying i, i think capital murder or capital punishment is the perfect solution in every case, you know, especially because there are some cases when you just don't know"
130065:25,"well, i guess there are some places, uh, in the north, in particular that, uh,  have a real definite way of encouraging you to recycle"
