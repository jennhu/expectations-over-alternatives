# Data for within-scale analysis

The file `some_database.tsv` was downloaded from Judith Degen's repository from the 2015 paper 
"Investigating the distribution of some (but not all) implicatures using corpora and web-based methods". 
You can find the original file [here](https://github.com/thegricean/corpus_some/blob/master/data/some_database.csv).

The file `sentences_for_model.csv` was generated by running `python get_model_inputs.py`.
This simply takes the unique items and sentences to feed the model, since the raw file
`some_database.tsv` has duplicates across human participants.

The folder `model_output` contains surprisal results for each of the tested alternatives
(see `../../run_bert_alternatives.sh`).
